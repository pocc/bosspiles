# bosspiles

A discord bot for the BGA bosspiles group: https://en.boardgamearena.com/group?id=2047909. 

## Setup

Run this on a VPS with autotools:

```bash
$ make install
$ make run
```

## Test

```bash
$ make test
```

## Usage

*Content in usage and examples is the same as the help document when you type `$$`.*

This bot needs to manage its own pinned message. If it finds a pinned bosspile,
it will repin it as its own message. A pinned bosspile must have a crown and climber.
Reset this bot's bosspile by deleting its pinned message, ensuring there is a bosspile
pinned by a person and then run `$$p`.
