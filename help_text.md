Bosspile Bot: Manage your discord ladders like a wizard

This bot needs to manage its own pinned message. If it finds a pinned bosspile,
it will repin it as its own message. A pinned bosspile must have a crown and climber.
Reset this bot's bosspile by deleting its pinned message, ensuring there is a bosspile
pinned by a person and then run `$p`.

__**Available Commands**__

    Shorten a command to the first letter like `$w` for `$ win`.

    **win**: Updates the bosspile with a win by player 1 over player 2
            `win <player 1>`
    **new**: Add a player to the bottom of the bosspile
            `new <player>`
    **edit**: Change the line for a player to the new one. The old line must match the beginning of the old player line (So it can be Q if there is only one player with a name starting with Q).
            `edit "<old player line>" "<new player line>"`
    **move**: Move a player/line up/down a number of spaces. Positive goes up; negative goes down.
            `move <player> <number of spaces>`
    **remove**: Remove a player from the bosspile
            `remove <player>`
    **active**: Change the status of a player to active or inactive (timer icon). If this bot sees a "player" with `**` or `__` (bold/italic markers) in their name, it treats it as an inactive heading.
            `active <player> <True|False>`
    **print**: Prints the current bosspile as a new message. Arg can be raw or debug, but is not required.
            `print <option>`
