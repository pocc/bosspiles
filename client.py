This bot needs to manage its own pinned message. If it finds a pinned bosspile,
it will repin it as its own message. A pinned bosspile must at least have a crown and climber.
To reset this bot's bosspile, delete its pinned message, make sure there is 
another bosspile pin, and then run any command.

__**Available Commands**__
    
    **win** <player 1> <player 2>
        Updates the bosspile with a win by player 1 over player 2

    **new** <player>
        Add a player to the bottom of the bosspile

    **edit** "<new player line>"
        Change the line for a player to the new one.

    **remove** <player>
        Remove a player from the bosspile

    **active** <player> <"true" or "false">
        Change the status of a player to active or inactive (timer icon)
    
    **print**
        Prints the current bosspile as a new message.

    All of these options change the bosspile.

            `$$win Alice`
        
        Expected Output includes result, as well as all new matches:
            `Alice defeats Bob`
            `Frank ‚öî Georgia`
            `Harriett ‚öî Ian`

    **edit**
        You want to edit player "Bob" to add a large blue diamond and climbing
            `$$edit "üî∑Bob‚è´"`
        
        Expected Output:
            `Bob ‚û°Ô∏è üî∑Bob‚è´`
    
    **remove**
        You want to remove player Dan:
            `$$remove Dan`
        
        Expected Output:
            `Dan has been removed.`

    **active**
        You want to make Eddie inactive and put a timer before his name:
            `$$active Eddie false`
        
        Expected Output:
            `Eddie is now inactive.`
